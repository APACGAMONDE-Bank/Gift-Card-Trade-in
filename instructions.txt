Accurics CLI Installation Steps

Prerequisite :- config.zip file and accurics cli file downloaded from accurics web console environment details

Installation and configuration Steps for Linux 

1.	Copy the accurics CLI into your usr/local/bin folder 

		cp accurics /usr/local/bin/


2.	Copy "config.zip" into the folder where you run "terraform plan" or "terragrunt plan" and unzip

		cp config.zip <terraform folder path>
		unzip config.zip

	
3.	Follow the sequence of commands needed for you to initialize terraform:

		accurics init [any shell scripts required to set variables, etc.]


4.	Finally, use the following command to scan your terraform/terragrunt code 
		For Terraform code - 
			accurics plan -config=<config file name> [optional variables that you would pass in terraform plan]
		
		For Terragrunt code -
			accurics tgplan -config=<config file name>
			accurics tgplanall -config=<config file name>

5. For CFT plan -
	accurics plan cf -config=<config file name> -templateFile=<template file name>[mandatory] -paramFile=<paramfile file name> -stackName=<stack name>
	Examples:
		- accurics plan cf -config=config -templateFile=template.json -paramFile=params.json stackName=mystack
		- accurics plan cf -config=config -templateFile=template.json
		- accurics plan cf -config=config -templateRepo=. (To recursive scan all directories)
	templateFile is mandatory, paramFile and stackName are optional


That's it! Now you can view your scan results on Accurics Platform.
